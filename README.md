This is Group 3's repository for module 8's assessment "Census API Data - Annual Business Survey 2019."
In this assessment we reviewed the data in United States Census Bureau's 2019 Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs, specifically Characteristics of Business Owners and Technology Characteristics of Businesses. 
All group members investigated a specific aspect of "what does a modern day business owner look like?"

- The ETL titled "ETL Report - What Does the Modern Day  Business Owner Look Like?" specifies the steps the team took to collectively extract the data from the Census Bureau website, transform the data to answer their respective questions, and lastly, to load each member's respective data into visualizations to communicate their findings. 
- All of the collective code specified in the ETL is documented in the file "main.ipynb"
- Our slide show titled "What does the Modern Day Business Owner Look Like? Presentation" presents our findings
